Starting off creating an object holding values for an instagram profile.
handle, name, bio, profile picture(setting a default pic until changed), numOfFollowers, numOfFollowing, etc.

Then make a way to prompt the user for an input without using html 
Then make a way using html

Now that you created a way to save inputs into an object
Make this a way to sign up 

Then once you've signed up you will be able to see the data displayed on the page in a profile data section
Use helper functions and whatever to make the code more efficient

Created a way to increament follower and following count
Now need to make a way to connect a relationship between different accounts if another account follows the relationship will be true
And it will increament follower count, when unfollowed the relationship will be false

Create a way of storing seperate accounts, research

Once signed up, be able to save data into backend
Then to sign in check if the handle or username inputted matches a user in the database

Created multiple users through creating a new object that holds the handle which is the name of the users profile data

Now try and delete the sumbit buttons so everything is inputted when pressing sign-up

Next make a sign-in page 
Created sign in page, when signed in will update profile screen

Now create a way for users to follow each other
